### 💻 My Tech Toolbox

Here are the programming languages I know and use:

| Language | What I Like About It |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Python` 🐍 | Great for getting things done quickly and clearly. Perfect for automation and fun projects! |
| `C` ⚙️ | Lets me talk directly to the computer. It's like the foundation of everything! |
| `C++` 🚀 | Super powerful and fast. I use it when I need that extra speed and control. |
| `SQL` 🗃️ | The language for talking to databases. It helps me organize and find data easily. |
